    <p>My name is prema, and i really love pet animals,especially dogs.<br>
    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.<br> 
    Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves.<br>
    the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative<br>
    Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.
